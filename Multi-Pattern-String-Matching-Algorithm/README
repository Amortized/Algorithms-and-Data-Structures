Problem Statement: Given patterns(p1,p2,p3,p4..) and their replacements(r1,r2,r3...) we would like to replace 
		   the patterns with their replacements in the text in sublinear time. 
		
		   We use Set Backward Oracle Matching Algorithm. It builds an oracle(automata) from all the patterns
		   where oracle represents all the possible substrings that can be made from the patterns. 

		   This algorithm is known to work well large keyword sets and varying keywords lengths.
		   Its closest competitor is Wu - Manber Algorithm.
