Problem Statement:
       1
      /  \
     2   3	

Finding Least Common Ancestor for two nodes of tree. In this case Ans is 1.

<Preprocessing, Querying>
solution in <O(N logN, O(logN)>

Example for Input:
         Assume Tree is like this
			1
		      /  \
		     2	  3
		   / | \
		  4  5  6
		  |  |  | 
		  7  8  9

No of Nodes: 9
Parents for each node(Breadth First Order) : -1 1 1 2 2 2 4 5 6
Level for Each Node: 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4
Enter two node whose LCA is to be found:3 6
Result: 1
